# Documentation

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

To get started follow these simple steps.

1. Open the Config application
2. Create Environments and Features in the app
3. Generate credentials for uploading from the app based on your provider of choice
4. Install a client library for your language
5. Wrap functionality in a "should"

<h2 id="client-libraries">Client Libraries</h2>

The magic happens inside of the client libraries. They consume the static
json config and perform all the significant logic. We are adding new
client language support as fast as we can.

Don't see your language? Help us decide by voting with a thumbs up on the
Github Project.

<h2 id="config-schema">Config Schema</h2>

This is what the json payload schema looks like.

```typescript
{
  environments: {
    [environmentName: string]: {
      [featureSetName: string]: { // currently hardcoded to "untagged"
        [featureName: string]:
          | VexillaToggleFeature
          | VexillaGradualFeature
          | VexillaSelectiveFeature;
      }
    };
  }
}
```

<h2 id="feature-types">Feature Types</h2>

Other feature types are being considered.

```typescript
enum VexillaFeatureType {
  TOGGLE = "toggle",
  GRADUAL = "gradual",
  SELECTIVE = "selective",
}

interface VexillaToggleFeature {
  type: VexillaFeatureType.TOGGLE;
  value: boolean;
}

interface VexillaGradualFeature {
  type: VexillaFeatureType.GRADUAL;
  value: number;
  seed: number;
}
```
