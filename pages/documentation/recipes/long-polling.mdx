# Caching

On your server, you probably want to cache the Vexilla Flags and config. This can save your users time. It can save your bandwidth costs.

One quick and easy way of keeping the cache up to date is long-polling. This involves just fetching from your static hosting on an interval and updating the cache.

Be warned that this can introduce lag time between changing a flag and when it gets updated on your server/client. In most cases, that is acceptable, but entirely depends on the length of your timer.

Here is a quick example of an Express.js based server and its long-polling mechanism:

```javascript
function foo() {
  console.log("adjklsfhdf fh h");
}
```

export default ({ children }) => (
  <DocumentationLayout meta={meta}>{children}</DocumentationLayout>
);
