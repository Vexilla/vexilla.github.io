# Response Codes

It is possible for your client and server to become out of sync due to caching and long-polling. In this case your server should respond with a specific status code to let the frontend know why a request might not have succeeded.

The recommended status code is **424**.

However, there are several status codes that also make sense.

- 412 - Precondition Failed
- 417 - Expectation Failed
- 422 - Unprocessable Entity
- 426 - Upgrade Required

They all make enough sense that you should just pick one and stay consistent with it.

If you want to look through other possible codes, check out https://http.cat or https://httpstatuses.com/

export default ({ children }) => (
  <DocumentationLayout meta={meta}>{children}</DocumentationLayout>
);
